# Budget Tic-Tac-Toe DAPP game


> The goal for the players is not just to win, but to stay within a budget. Each move comes at a cost equivalent to the number of wins attainable in that space. A draw splits the pot without returning their initial stake.

## ðŸ–‡ How to Start

- open your terminal and go to the folder you want to clone the repo to
- git clone https://github.com/coolpythoncodes/ttt.git

# From the project root path

cd src/reach
